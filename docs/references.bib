abstract = {We discuss all the necessary parameters to describe optical racetrack micro            resonators fabricated with silicon on insulator (SOI) technology. We focus on some            fundamental aspects crucial for a comprehensive and realistic modelling of racetrack            resonators as building blocks of complex add-drop filters, like SCISSOR (Side-Coupled            Integrated Spaced-Sequences of Resonators) or CROW (Coupled Resonator Optical            Waveguides). When the radius of curvature is lower than 5 $\mu$m, and/or the separation gaps between waveguide and resonator is small,            dispersion law, effective index mismatch, and mode mismatch between bend and straight            waveguides are relevant for modelling. A new mode solver, specifically suited for high            index contrast small mode area waveguides, is used whose results are compared with the            measurement of the optical response of some resonant devices.},
