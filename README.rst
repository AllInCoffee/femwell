Working on a finite element based simulation tool for integrated circuits, electric and photonic!

****************
Working Features
****************

- Photonic eigenmode solver
- Electric eigenmode solver
- Thermal mode solver (static and transient)
- Coulomb solver

*********************
Possible Simulations
*********************

- Eigenmodes of wavegudies and determining their effective refractive index
- Eigenmodes of electric transmission lines and determining their propagation constant (in work)
- Static thermal profiles
- Transient thermal behavior
- Static electric fields
- Overlap integrals between waveguide modes
- Overlap integral between a waveguide mode and a fiber mode
- Coupled mode theory - coupling between adjacent waveguides
- Heat based photonic phase shifters
- Pockels based photonic phase shifters
